# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Telugu Movie Recommendation System using Agentic AI and Deep Learning

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Project Name
Intelligent Telugu Movie Recommendation System with Multi-Source Review Analysis

### 1.2 Project Vision
Build an intelligent recommendation system that uses Agentic AI and Deep Learning to analyze reviews written in the Telugu language and provide context-aware movie suggestions. The system will automatically collect data from multiple platforms (Twitter, TMDB), process Telugu reviews using Siamese Networks for sentiment classification and domain understanding, and generate personalized movie recommendations without human intervention.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
Existing recommendation systems have significant limitations:
- Focus only on English reviews and simple sentiment-based methods
- Single data source (Twitter only) with no multi-platform support
- Manual processes with no automation for data collection, analysis, or recommendations
- Non-context-aware recommendations based purely on sentiment polarity
- Limited scalability for large datasets
- No support for regional languages like Telugu
- Use older algorithms (SVM/CNN) that are less accurate

### 1.4 Solution Overview
The proposed system addresses these gaps by:
1. Supporting Telugu language reviews with multi-source data collection
2. Implementing autonomous Agentic AI pipeline for end-to-end automation
3. Providing context-aware recommendations using domain classification
4. Using modern Siamese Networks for accurate sentiment analysis
5. Handling large datasets with scalable architecture
6. Preventing duplicate data storage with intelligent caching
